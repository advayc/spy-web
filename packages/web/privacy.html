      Privacy Policy
    </h1>
    <p><a href="/index.html">← Back to Main</a></p>
    <p class="muted">Effective: September 6, 2025</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Spy ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our party game application ("App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and other relevant regulations.</p>

    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from users. The App operates entirely on your device without requiring internet connectivity for core functionality.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
      <li><strong>No Location Data:</strong> The App does not access or collect location information.</li>
      <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not use third-party analytics services that track user behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>No Cookies:</strong> The web version does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How We Use Information</h3>
    <p>Since we do not collect any information, there is no use of personal data. All game data (e.g., player names, scores, custom topics) is stored locally on your device and is not shared with us or any third parties.</p>

    <h3>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose any user information because we do not collect it. We do not engage in data sharing practices.</p>

    <h3>Data Security</h3>
    <p>Although we do not collect personal data, we are committed to security best practices. Local data on your device is managed by your device's operating system. We recommend keeping your device secure with passwords, biometric locks, and regular updates.</p>

    <h3>Data Retention</h3>
    <p>Any data stored locally (e.g., game settings) remains on your device until you delete the App or clear your device's storage. We do not retain any data on our servers.</p>

    <h3>User Rights</h3>
    <p>Under applicable laws like GDPR and CCPA:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can access any local data stored on your device through the App's settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete all local data by uninstalling the App or clearing app data in your device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Local data can be exported or backed up as per your device's capabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> Since no data is collected, there are no tracking or marketing opt-outs needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us using the information below.</p>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>The App may integrate with platform services (e.g., App Store for purchases, Google Play for distribution). These services have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We do not control or have access to data handled by these platforms.</p>

    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>The App is suitable for general audiences, including children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.</p>

    <h3>International Data Transfers</h3>
    <p>Since no data is collected or transmitted, there are no international data transfers.</p>

    <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of material changes by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy and, if necessary, through in-app notifications or other reasonable means. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h3>Contact Us</h3>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our practices, please contact us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email: <a href="mailto:advay.chandorkar@gmail.com">advay.chandorkar@gmail.com</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Severability</h3>
    <p>If any provision of this Privacy Policy is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

    <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
    <p>This Privacy Policy constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the App.</p>
